//! `yruwg…::AGC(float**, unsigned long)` (Riverrun @ 0x21db0, Deep Phase Nine
//! has the same code) with `InitAGC(gain, floor, down, up, threshold, 300)`.
//!
//! A 300-sample look-ahead: the peak of the *incoming* sample (over all
//! channels) decides the gain applied to the sample leaving the delay line.
//! Per sample: if `gain · peak > threshold` the gain is multiplied by `down`;
//! if `gain < floor` it is multiplied by `up`. Each plug-in picks its own
//! numbers — see the constructors.
